2021 noodles

this is an old project made using the pspdev kit, now being updated for hopefully some time

## known bugs
players hitbox is bigger than how the player appears
if you eat too much food and players the whole map shrinks into nothingness and player is left alone in a blank world

THE CRASHING IS FIXED! it was because the player's small was smaller than 40

## todo
hopefully fix the glitches (probably with help from psp development community)
add viruses (green spiky circles)

## building
open a terminal in the src directory and type "make". itll make a EBOOT.pbp file for you to play

## putting on your psp
make a folder and in that folder copy every png file other than ICON0.png and PIC1.png into the folder
put built eboot.pbp in the folder with the copyed png files and put the folder in PSP/GAME
goto games and you will see the game
