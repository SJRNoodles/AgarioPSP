# agar.io PSP edition

this is an old project made using the pspdev kit, now being updated for hopefully some time

## bugs
players hitbox is bigger than how the player appears
if you eat too much food and players the whole map shrinks into nothingness and player is left alone in a blank world

## todo
hopefully fix the glitches (probably with help from psp development community)
add textures to everything to make them look like circles
add viruses (green spiky circles)

## building
open a terminal in the src directory and type "make". itll make a EBOOT.pbp file for you to play
