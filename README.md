# agar.io PSP edition

this is an old project made using the pspdev kit

## bugs
frame buffer is odd. i planned on adding a new graphics thingy but i dont have one to use at the moment
game crashes if glitched dots hit top edge

if anyone finds fixes for the glitches that would be great

## building
open a terminal in the src directory and type "make". itll make a EBOOT.pbp file for you to play
